              About <span>Greecania</span>
            </h1>
            <p>
              Introducing Greecania; Greek in India. The range of authentic
              Greek ice creams, authentic Greek yogurt desserts, authentic Greek
              flavored yogurts, authentic Greek puddings, and some more exciting
              products in the range to fulfill your daily dietary and
              nutritional essentials with an astonishing taste of Greece.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our company is inspired by the age-old traditional ways, based on
              unique and original recipes combined from the genuine Greek
              origin. To date, the company has been manufacturing products made
              from sheep milk but it was on exploring the international market
              when we found that the products tasted well and were made of
              better quality with the use of Cow milk. India is a highly
              populated country where the production and consumption of dairy
              products are on a high level. Hence we decided to establish our
              new venture in India by the name of GREECANIA; a perfect blend of
              the Greek flavors to tickle the Indian taste buds.
